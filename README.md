# EigenFaces
Implementation of Face Recognition using Eigenfaces.
This paper delves into the implementation of face detection using the concept of Eigenfaces. The work highlights the prospective of an OpenCV aided facial detection system. The aim of facial recognition is to detect faces in still images and has many methods such as local, global, and hybrid approach.

# Introduction
Face detection has been a computationally complex problem to solve: including the several dynamic variables and the differences that may exist between the training and the testing images. These variables could include the difference in lighting and angle difference in head tilting.
This design is hence focused on developing an early system that does not depend on three-dimensional geometry. This system is efficient in its scope of usage: computationally fast and reasonably simple. 
This system works well for constrained environments such as a household or an official environment with limited computational ability.
